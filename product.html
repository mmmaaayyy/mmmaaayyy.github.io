<center><p>My Choice is an interactive "Choose Your Own Adventure" game that brings awareness to intersectional feminism by allowing the user to experience everyday prejudices firsthand. The user can make choices as their character, and see how their insignificant personal choices such as answering a question in a computer science class can lead to comments such as "wow, you're smart for a pretty girl". Many people see feminism as an overwhelming and distant problem, so with our game, we attempt to make these issues more relatable.</p></center>
