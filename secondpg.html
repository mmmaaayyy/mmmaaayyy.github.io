        <strong>#Girlyoudontneedmakeup</strong><br /> 
        Amy Schumer, actor and comedian, created a parody video revealing how men encourage women to go makeup-free, but judge once they do. Some lyrics include:
        <p>"Girl you don't need makeup, you're perfect when you wake up"..."Hold up, girl we spoke too soon, I didn't realize that your lashes were so stubby and pale just a little mascara and you'll look female"..."girl you don't need makeup just don't go outside like that, OK?"..."we met someone else, we're out".</p>
        this video has empowered many women to share their no makeup selfies online, and hopefully this video will encourage you to ignore judgements from society and believe in your OWN confidence!
