	<p> We are participating in the GirlsWhoCode program at IBM. We noticed that many people, including girls, have misconceptions about feminism and the reality behind sexism. Girls are made to feel responsible for the comments they recieve everyday, when really they should be taught that their decisions about their own clothing or body do not warrant sexual harassment or discrimination. We hope that our game will show young and older people what girls go through on a daily basis, and allow them to experience the hateful and invasive comments themselves. </p>
