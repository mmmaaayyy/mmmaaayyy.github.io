	<p> We are participating in the GirlsWhoCode program at IBM. We noticed that many people, including girls, have misconceptions about feminism and the commonality of it in our everyday lives. Girls are made to feel responsible for the comments they receive everyday, when really they should be taught that their decisions about their own clothing or body do not warrant sexual harassment or discrimination. We hope that our game will show young and older people how one little decision can result in many hateful consequences for women, and allow them to experience these prejudices firsthand. </p>
