	<center><p><font size="3">This game was created by May Yang, Karla Majdancic and Maeve Miller.</font></p></center>
	<center><p><font size="3">We are participating in the GirlsWhoCode program at IBM this summer.</font></p></center>
	<center><p><font size="3">We noticed that many people, including girls, have misconceptions about the frequency of sexism in our everyday lives, and how this actually has a huge impact on their futures.</font></p></center>
	<center><p><font size="3">Most of these misconceptions result from limited knowledge and resources on the subject. We hope that our game will show young and older people how women feel when their small and personal decisions result in the many scary and hurtful consequences that real women experience daily.</font></p></center>
	<center><p><font size="3">Most importantly, our game intends for the public to learn about important organizations while having fun!</p></center>
