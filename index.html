Feminism is about gaining equal rights and opportunities for women, and allowing women to have control over their lives and bodies. At a time when women are sexualized and objectified in so many cultures, feminism is also about empowering women and young girls.As we live in a world centered around technology, it has become  easy for women to connect and share their experiences with feminism with the online world. However, this also gives way to victims of sexual harassment  By simply scrolling through a Facebook newsfeed or a Twitter feed, there will often be stories about girls getting sent home because they broke a vague/sexist dress code or incidents of verbal and physical sexual harassment. Because of its prominence in our social media, and our lives, it’s clear that this problem is very real and that these individuals need to be heard.We want to invent a way for all people to experience what it is like to grow up as a girl, and to bring attention to intersectional feminism. We wanted to portray the character though a choose your own adventure game because such a small, insignificant choice can actually alter how society views you. After searching the internet for women’s personal stories dealing with these issues, we thought it would be right to incorporate these stories, as well as statistics, into our game to show that feminism isn’t just a “vague idea”, but it is real and society’s norms have an affect on girls’ lives.
